# MetaMaskDebug
MetaMask mobile wallet enables WebView debugging mode, allowing direct debugging of DAPP using Google Chrome.

In addition, based on the official source code, we make the following commitments: We will not collect user's private data, such as private keys or mnemonic phrases, and there are no backdoors. The primary purpose of modifying this wallet is for our own use and to facilitate compatibility testing with applications in the cryptocurrency industry. As a source of revenue, users will be charged for debugging Dapps.

This application has undergone minor modifications based on the official source code, with the following changes.

The version number of MetaMask mobile for Android is v7.3.0.
Two main functionalities are supported:

1.HTTPS DApps do not validate certificates, making it convenient for developers to debug DApps within the local network--free.

2.WebView's DEBUG mode is unlocked, facilitating source code debugging of DApps using "inspect with chrome developer tools" - available for a fee.

Please download our latest version of the application for installation. The file is a bit large, so please use a download manager for assistance, such as Thunder or BitTorrent. The download link is as follows:
